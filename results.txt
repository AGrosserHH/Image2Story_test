a woman with a shaved head and a black shirt
short story 
She looked in the mirror and saw a stranger staring back at her
 Her once long, flowing hair was now gone, shaved off in a matter of seconds
 And her once bright and colorful wardrobe was now replaced with a simple black shirt
 She didn't know who this person was, but she knew she had to find out


She started by small steps, wearing all black and only leaving her house at night
 She felt like a vampire, existing only in the darkness
 She was drawn to the darkness, to the mystery it held
 She began to experiment with drugs and alcohol, anything to numb the pain of her new reality


Eventually, she found herself in a dark alley, surrounded by shady characters
 She felt at home here, among the misfits and outcasts
 This was her new family, her new life
 And she was never going back to the person she once was

a crocheted blanket is laying on the floor
A woman is sitting on the floor, crocheting a blanket
 She is surrounded by yarn of all different colors
 The blanket is layng on the floor next to her
 She is concentrating intently on her work, and the blanket is slowly taking shape
